Hybrid Cipher: Substitution & Transposition Encryption
This project implements a hybrid cipher that combines substitution and transposition techniques to enhance security. It provides 128-bit encryption strength, making it resistant to common attacks.

How It Works
Substitution Phase – Replaces characters based on a key, hiding frequency patterns.
Transposition Phase – Rearranges characters using a key to obscure text structure.
Multi-Round Encryption – Repeats substitution and transposition for stronger security.
