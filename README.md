Introduction

The Hybrid Cipher is an encryption technique that enhances data security by combining substitution and transposition methods. This hybrid approach ensures strong encryption, making it difficult for attackers to break the cipher using traditional cryptanalysis methods. The implementation follows a multi-round encryption process to further strengthen data protection, ensuring at least 128-bit security.

Features

âœ… Stronger Security â€“ Uses both substitution and transposition to prevent frequency analysis and structural pattern detection.
âœ… Multi-Round Encryption â€“ Encrypts data multiple times for added security.
âœ… Custom Key-Based Encryption â€“ Generates unique encryption for different keys.
âœ… Scalable & Efficient â€“ Can be adapted for higher encryption strength.
âœ… Easy Implementation â€“ Developed in Python and runs on Google Colab with minimal setup.

How It Works

Substitution Phase â€“ Each letter in the plaintext is replaced using a key-based transformation to disrupt frequency patterns.
Transposition Phase â€“ The encrypted text is shuffled based on a key, making it harder to recognize letter positions.
Multiple Rounds of Encryption â€“ The combination of substitution and transposition is applied multiple times to increase complexity.
Key Expansion & Randomization â€“ A dynamic key scheduling method ensures that each encryption cycle produces a unique output.
